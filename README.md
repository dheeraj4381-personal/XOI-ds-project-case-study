# Make and Model Prediction Project

## Overview

The main aim of this project is to:

1. Understand some defining characteristics of this data set through EDA
2. Characterize the types of errors we are getting in the Make values and determine the error records
3. Determine how we can map erroneous Make values to correct Makes
4. Investigate building a model to predict the Make from the Model data. How would we go about doing this?
5. what are the future plans that I would like to implement it fort this project?

## Implementation

Create a python notebook with step by step implemenation of the follwoing steps:

1. Performed EDA to understand the data, 
	a. Looked for missing data,
	b. Plotted frequency distribution of top 10 Makes and models
	c. Applied different strategies to figure out invalid Makes, Models and removed them.

2. Divided the data set into Dominant and Rare Make categories.
	a. Categorized different type of errors with examples.

3. Apply fuzzy matching technique to find the best match to map erroneous Make values to correct Makes

4. Applied Feature engineering steps before training the data.
	a. Experimented with machine learning algorithms like XGBoost, Random Forest. Due to time constraint I was not able to train the model, but has provided the necessary steps to build and Predict.
	b. The model's performance will be evaluated using metrics such as accuracy, precision, recall, and F1-score.

5. Added future steps that I would like to implement if additional time is available.
